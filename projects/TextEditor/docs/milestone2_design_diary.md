# Design Diary
Use this space to talk about your process.  For inspiration, see [my prompts](../../../docs/sample_reflection.md)

At first, my code was not ready for vectors and the flexibility of cursor movement that I needed. It took a lot of time
of trying to implement vectors and scrolling to realize that the structure of my code was note gonna work with me. So, 
I decided to refactor all of my code and restructure it in a way that allowed me to easily place the cursor where I wanted
to. 
Figuring out how to take user_input in the form of a string and use it to open the text file was a length process. This is the
particular site i got the solution from: https://www.techiedelight.com/convert-vector-chars-std-string/
It was exactly what i needed and will definitely need later on in this project. and i definitely wouldn't be surprised if I
have to refactor my code once again to be compatible with the main window instead of just the temporary 'open file' window.
All in all, I think this milestone was successful in that I figured out the problems I was having and solved them
in due time. It wasn't a struggle conceptually, but syntacticly and trying to type the right things to make what I
want to happen, happen.
