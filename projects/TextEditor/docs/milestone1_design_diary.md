The beginning of the project was particularly frustrating. Getting curses.h to work was as struggle. However, it did
remind me of the pain and struggle of not understanding what is wrong and the problem is right in front of your face.
After getting it to work it was a lot of fun to begin coding a terminal window text editor.
I was never quite able to figure out how to make each option in the options bar in it's own window.
I would really recommend asking questions as soon as they pop up in the head. This is because it is quite
easy to fall behind even in such a seemingly simple assignment and it's worth getting a lot of practice with it.
The most challenging aspect of the assignment was staying patient with the language. The way curses works is different
than anything else I've used in C++. 
Another challenge was not getting ahead of myself. I found that I have many big ideas for the text editor, but because
of lack of experience and time, I had to hold myself back many times.
